# 🔔 Full-Screen Alarm Notification System

## ✅ What's Implemented:

### **Complete Alarm System for Medication Reminders**

Your app now has a **professional full-screen alarm notification system** that triggers at the exact times you set for each medication!

## 🎯 How It Works:

### **When You Add a Medication:**

1. You set reminder times (e.g., 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 8:00 PM)
2. App **automatically schedules notifications** for each time
3. Notifications repeat based on frequency:
   - **Daily:** Every day at set times
   - **Weekly:** Every week
   - **Monthly:** Every month
   - **Custom:** Only on selected days (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri)

### **When Alarm Triggers:**

1. **📱 Notification appears** in your notification bar
2. **When you tap it or if app is open:**
   - **Full-screen blue popup appears**
   - Shows large **medicine image** (if you added one) OR colored circle with 💊
   - Displays medication name in large text
   - Shows the scheduled time

3. **Three Action Options:**
   - **✓ I Took It** (Green button) - Marks as taken & closes alarm
   - **⏰ Snooze** - Closes alarm temporarily
   - **Dismiss** - Just closes the alarm

## 🔐 Permissions Configured:

All necessary Android permissions are set up:

- ✅ `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - Schedule notifications at exact times
- ✅ `USE_EXACT_ALARM` - Use precise timing
- ✅ `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Show notifications (Android 13+)

- ✅ `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` - Display over other apps

## 🎨 Full-Screen Alarm Design:

**Beautiful Blue Background:**
- 🔔 Large alarm icon at top
- 🖼️ Medicine image (200x200 circle) OR colored circle

## 🎯 Example Scenario:

**You add "Aspirin":**
- Color: Red
- Times: 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 8:00 PM
- Frequency: Daily

**What Happens:**
1. App schedules 3 daily notifications
