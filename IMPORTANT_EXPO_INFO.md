# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Understanding Your App Setup

## What Happened:

You have **TWO DIFFERENT APPS** in this repository:

### 1. ðŸ“± Expo React Native App (What We've Been Building)
- **Location:** `/pill-reminder-expo/` folder
- **Type:** React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Testing:** Use **Expo Go** app
- **ALL our work is here:** Modern time picker, medication management, etc.

### 2. ðŸ¤– Native Android App (Separate Project)
- **Location:** `/app/` folder (Kotlin/Java)
- **Type:** Native Android
- **Testing:** Build APK and install
- **Status:** This is a DIFFERENT app, NOT updated with our Expo features

## ðŸŽ¯ The Issue:

**The APK you downloaded is from the NATIVE Android app**, which is a separate codebase and doesn't have any of the features we built! 

All our work (time picker, medications, images, etc.) is in the **Expo app** which you test using **Expo Go**.

## âœ… Solution: Use Expo Go (What We've Been Using)

### Fresh Expo Go Link (Just Restarted):

```
exp://zj_usvw-wahidsuman-8081.exp.direct
```

### How to Connect:

1. **Close Expo Go completely** (swipe away from recent apps)
2. **Reopen Expo Go**
3. **Clear any old projects** (long press and remove)
4. **Tap "Enter URL manually"**
5. **Paste:** `exp://zj_usvw-wahidsuman-8081.exp.direct`
6. **Connect!**

## ðŸ”„ What I Just Did:

âœ… Killed all old Expo processes
âœ… Cleared all caches (.expo, node_modules cache, npm cache)
âœ… Started fresh development server
âœ… Generated new tunnel URL
âœ… Server is clean and ready!

## ðŸ“± If You Want a Real APK of the Expo App:

To build an APK of the **Expo app** (with all our features), you need to:

1. Run: `eas build --platform android --profile preview`
2. This requires EAS (Expo Application Services) setup
3. Takes 15-20 minutes to build in the cloud
4. Downloads a real APK with all features

**For now, please use Expo Go - it's faster for development!**

## ðŸ’¡ Why Expo Go is Better for Development:

- âœ… Instant updates (1-2 seconds)
- âœ… No need to rebuild APK every time
- âœ… Perfect for testing features
- âœ… Fast iteration

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:

1. Use the new Expo Go link above
2. Test all the features we built
3. When you're ready for a real APK, let me know and I'll set up EAS Build

---

**TL;DR:** Use Expo Go with the new link above. The APK from GitHub Actions is a different app!
